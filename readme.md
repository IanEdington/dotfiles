# This doc explains how I have my mac set up for optimum usablilty while developing.

I am a newbie... or at least I was when I started this repo. I have been developing for just over a year. I decided to document the changes I am making to my mac, for my own sanity and so hopefully other can benefit.

# .profile

This is where I have made a ton of changes over this past year. Unfortunately, I didn't start this repo until quite a bit later and I can't remeber where I got my base file. If anyone knows send me a message, credit where credit is due and all that.
